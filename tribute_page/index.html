                    <p>Edward Jenner was an English physician and scientist who was the pioneer of smallpox vaccine, 
                    the world's first vaccine. The terms "vaccine" and "vaccination" are derived from <em>Variolae vaccinae</em> (smallpox of the cow), 
                    the term devised by Jenner to denote cowpox. Jenner is often called "the father of immunology", and his work is said to 
                    have "saved more lives than the work of any other human". In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC's list of the 100 
                    Greatest Britons.</p>

                    <p>Edward Anthony Jenner was born on 17 May 1749 in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, as the eighth of nine children. 
                    His father, the Reverend Stephen Jenner, was the vicar of Berkeley, so Jenner received a strong basic education.
                    He went to school in Wotton-under-Edge and Cirencester. During this time, he was inoculated for smallpox, which had a 
                    lifelong effect upon his general health. At the age of 14, he was apprenticed for seven years to Daniel Ludlow, a surgeon 
                    of Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire, where he gained most of the experience needed to become a surgeon himself. In 1770, 
                    Jenner became apprenticed in surgery and anatomy under surgeon John Hunter and others at St George's Hospital. William Osler 
                    records that Hunter gave Jenner William Harvey's advice, very famous in medical circles (and characteristic of the Age of 
                    Enlightenment), "Don't think; try." Hunter remained in correspondence with Jenner over natural history and proposed him for 
                    the Royal Society. Returning to his native countryside by 1773, Jenner became a successful family doctor and surgeon, 
                    practising on dedicated premises at Berkeley.</p>

            <h3>What is smallpox?</h2>
            <p>Smallpox is believed to have emerged in human populations about 10,000 BC. The earliest physical evidence of it is probably the pustular rash 
            on the mummified body of Pharaoh Ramses V of Egypt. The disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans annually during the closing years of the 18th century 
            (including five reigning monarchs), and was responsible for a third of all blindness. Of all those infected, 20–60 percent—and over 80 percent of infected 
            children—died from the disease. Smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300–500 million deaths during the 20th century. As recently as 1967, the World 
            Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and that two million died in that year.</p>

            <h3>His Legacy</h2>
            In 1979, the World Health Organization declared smallpox an eradicated disease. This was the result of coordinated public health efforts, but vaccination was an 
            essential component. Although the disease was declared eradicated, some pus samples still remain in laboratories in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
            in Atlanta in the US, and in State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia. Jenner's vaccine laid the foundation 
            for contemporary discoveries in immunology. In 2002, Jenner was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote. The lunar crater Jenner 
            is named in his honour. Jenner was recognized in the TV show The Walking Dead. In "TS-19", a CDC scientist is named Edwin Jenner.
